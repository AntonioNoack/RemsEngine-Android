# RemsEngine-Android
This is the official port of Rem's Engine to Android, with the focus being to run games.
So it's ok to only support our custom mesh format, and limited image formats, as the conversion
can automatically happen during the game export (not yet implemented except for deep-imported meshes).

## Progress
Good:
 - UI working
 - text working, including emojis
 - forward rendering working
 - mouse-centric UI is usable via touch

Bad:
 - sky is missing when using deferred rendering :/
 - not everything is necessarily tested or supported
