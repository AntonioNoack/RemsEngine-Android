# RemsEngine-Android
This is a try to port Rem's Engine to Android

Since I am using AWT and LWJGL in Rem's Engine, this indirectly also is a partial port of those libararies.

## Progress
Good:
 - UI working
 - text working, basic AWT replaced
 

Bad:
 - random 70px cursor offset
 - flickering of background :/
 - a lot of debug info from Rem's Engine is incorrect
 - crashes sometimes ^^
